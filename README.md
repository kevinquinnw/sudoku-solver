# sudoku-solver
This is a sudoku solver using the backtracking algorithm. It includes a graphical GUI so just run the GUI.py to play the game. I hope you enjoy :) 


# Instructions

Click a box and hit the number on the keyboard to pencil in the number. To confirm the value that you press on the keyboard, hit the ENTER key on that box. To delete a pencil in, you can click DEL. 

Finally, to solve the board press SPACE and the algorithm will run. 

# How it Works 

The backtracking algorithm is a recursive alg. that attempts to solve a given problem by testing all possible routes towards a solution until a solution is found. If a solution is not found, the algorithm will backtrack to test another route. This will go on until a solution is found or every path has been tested. 

It may not always be effective but I wanted to try using a recursive function that calls itself until the condition is met.
